# rtd-testing-scripts
A collection of scripts to automate bash commands for practice

I use this script mostly for creating an archive of a small network attached storage device and placing a copy of it onto an external drive. It has a main menu to select a few different bash scripts that do various things. One of which is a text game, another is a bookmark verifier.
